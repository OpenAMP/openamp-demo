Summary of testing 2022/11/11-12 for qemu hang/crash/fail

tested with 3 different kernel
    6.0.0       openamp-staging-6.0 = v6.0 + Tanmay's zynqmp remoteproc & Arnaud's ept patch
                    uses zynqmp_defconfig made from Xilinx vendor config
    6.0.7       as above plus cherry pix of pinctrl fix (not really 6.0.7 but a preview)
    xil-5.15    Xilinx vendors kernel as built by 2022.1_update3

I did two test runs that counted:
11-11 did 58  boots of each kernel (after that /tmp filled up and everything failed)
                xil-5.15 actually only did 57 runs
11-12 did 100 boots of each kernel (export TMP=~/big/tmp)

Fails/total
6.0.0       32/158
6.0.7       0/158
xil-5.15    1/157

The xil-5.15 error is obviously an outlier.
I was actually watching at that time.
That failure was very different.
No initial PMU messages came out.
It just said "Starting qemu" until the host pane killed it.

Conclusions:
* 6.0.0 definitely has issues
* 6.0.7 is much better
* there may be some other issue VERY occasionally
* keep and eye out for issues
* look at new versions of side load firmware or qemu binaries
